# El0ps.jl

*An Exact L0-penalized Problem Solver.*

## Summary

This package provides solution methods to address problems of the form

$$\min_{\mathbf{x}} \ f(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}) + \lambda g(\mathbf{x})$$

where $g(\mathbf{x}) = \|\mathbf{x}\|_0 + h(\mathbf{x})$.
Such problems aim to minimize a loss function $f$ of some linear model $\mathbf{Ax}$.
It also enforces sparsity in the optimizers with the $\ell_0$-norm, which counts the number of non-zero entries in its input.
The function $h$ is a perturbation term required to build-up efficient numerical procedures.
In particular, this package implements a Branch-and-Bound algorithm that exploits the structure of the problem to achieve competitive performances.
It it designed to be robust to dimensionality scaling and flexible with respect to the choice of the functions $f$ and $h$.
